# Chatbot

Simple chatbot using python

These python scripts collectively build a chatbot application using tkinter for the GUI and deep learning techniques for response generation:

### Chat Interface (app.py):
The primary user interface is crafted using tkinter, offering a straightforward chat window. Users can type messages and view both their queries and the bot's responses in real time.

### Chat Mechanics (chat.py):
This script is responsible for interfacing with the trained model. When a user sends a message, it gets processed here to produce an appropriate response from the chatbot.

### Model Definition (model.py): 
The neural network architecture for the chatbot, likely an LSTM or another recurrent model, is defined here. This script outlines how the chatbot thinks and processes user input.

### Natural Language Processing (nltk_utils.py): 
This script handles the pre-processing of text data. It tokenizes sentences, preprocesses the data, and has utilities for converting between bag-of-words representations and actual sentences.

### Training Procedure (train.py): 
This script oversees the training of the chatbot on a given dataset. It likely uses the model from model.py and the utilities from nltk_utils.py to train the bot to understand and respond to user queries.


In essence, these scripts together form a holistic chatbot system, from the user interface down to the underlying neural model.
